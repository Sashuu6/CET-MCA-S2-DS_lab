# CET-MCA-S2-DS_lab
This repository contains the programs I developed under data structures lab, during my 2nd semester in C language. The lab questions are divided into 3 cycles + 2 test cycles.

## Cycle-1

1.   Traversal
2.   Sorting
3.   searching, search and sort
4.   Write a game program as follows
     i) Read the size of the square matrix N*N
     ii) Display a square matrix (blank) of N*N
     iii) Allow the player to insert data into the matrix as displayed (you should have a chance to the user to confirm the entry and 
          to alter the previous entries,if desired.)
     iv) After completion of all the entries from the player ,count the score as follows:
         Score=0(zero) if it is not a magic square.Otherwise the score=P*10,where P is the number of alteration of entries.
         The player's performance will be judged by the minimum score achieved other than zero.
5.   Represntation of sparse matrix using 2- d array.

## Cycle-2

1. Library management.
2. Polynomial
3. Stack
4. GCD of 2 numbers

## Cycle-3

1. Bank
2. JO
3. Quick sort
4. Merge sort
